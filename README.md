## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (for managing pull requests)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Muadeel56/wedding-website.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd wedding-website
   ```
3. Install NPM packages:

## Project Structure & Workflow

- **Components**: Reusable components like `Header`, `Footer`, `Layout`, and `SplashScreen` are located in `src/components`.
- **Pages**: Main page components like `Home`, `Gallery`, `OurStory`, and `EventDetails` are in `src/pages`.
- **Media Handling**: All media assets (images, videos) should be uploaded to Cloudinary. The URLs are then used in the relevant components. This ensures the repository remains lightweight and the website performs optimally.
- **Routing**: Client-side routing is handled by `react-router-dom`. All routes are defined in `App.jsx`.
- **Styling**: The entire theme is controlled from `src/index.css` using CSS custom properties and Tailwind's `@theme` directive, with support for both light and dark modes.

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
